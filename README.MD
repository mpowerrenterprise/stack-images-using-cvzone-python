## What is CVZONE?

CVzone is the main Framework that is used in this prototype, it is a computer vision package that makes us easy to run like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc., and also image processing and other AI functions.


## Configuration and Setup

Python is the main programming language of this prototype, OpenCV and CVzone are the major Frameworks.


- Installing OpenCV

  ```python
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Installing cvzone

    ```python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

- Or, Installing cvzone using GitHub, (If "pip install cvzone" does not work)

    ```python
